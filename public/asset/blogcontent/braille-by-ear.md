I just launched "Braille by Ear" for Android!

# Why?

Braille literacy is astonishingly low.
Only 7% of blind people in the UK use Braille.
And yet we know that literacy is a hugely important for allowing people to fill their potential.
In the US, only 30% of blind adults are employed. But if you can read Braille, that figure suddenly shoots up to 85%.

However, many current methods for learning Braille require either expensive equipment, or some level of sight. This has left the people who need Braille the most with few accessible options. 

I joined the RevenueCat Shipaton with the aim of addressing this problem:

# How does it work?

Brailliac: Braille by Ear is the world's first Braille learning app designed specifically for blind users.

It was designed from the ground up with 2 unique aims: 
- To teach Braille through sound and touch, using nothing but a regular smartphone.
- To be easy and fast to navigate without sight.

The result is the Virtual Braille Cell, where your very own fingers become Braille dots.

And of course, it needs to be fun! Braille by Ear teaches Braille through guided audio lessons, then offers fun educational games for practising your skills. Type Braille against the clock in time trials, practise Braille numbers by solving math puzzles, and hone your dictation skills with real audiobooks.

# How did I make it?

I was honoured to be selected by JetBrains to receive a free license for their AI coding assistant Junie, to help with this project.
