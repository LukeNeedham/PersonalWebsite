Earlier this week I published my latest little ditty: Video Diary.

You can download it right now on F-Droid: [f-droid.org/packages/com.lukeneedham.videodiary](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.lukeneedham.videodiary)

# What is it?

Video Diary is an Android app for anyone who's ever felt the urge to record snippets of their daily life.

Each day you take a single video of something cool you're doing. The video is ultra-short - just 3 seconds (by default).  At the end of the day, the video gets locked in and can't be changed anymore. And if some day you forget to take a video in time, that's too bad...

# Why would I want that?

The idea is that each day you collect a live, raw, unedited snippet of your life. You can't add that holiday video from half a year ago. You can't pass off your super-cool friend's video as your own. You can't add 10 videos from that one crazy night out. You can't come back and edit it later. You can't pretend your life is more exciting than it is. It's your diary - it records the story you're writing.

# What should I do with all these snippets?

You go back in time and admire them! Scroll through the app to hop through your life day by day, or jump straight to any past date.

At some point you might decide you're ready to share your video diary with the world. Thats where the Export feature comes in. Simply let the app know which chunk of your life you want to show off, and it will handle exporting all the included snippets to a single seamless video.

Maybe you want to see what your January looked like. Maybe you want to share your fortnight in Amsterdam with your grandparents. Maybe you want to ruin your mate's new year party by showing everyone an 18-minute recap of your entire past year.

Watch your life flash before your eyes - and enjoy the show!

# Why did you build this?

I started this project as something to keep myself busy over Christmas. I knew people keeping video diaries, and I wanted to start my own. I wanted to finish it before the new year, so that on the 1st of January I could take my first daily video of 2025.

But I didn't want to have to sit for hours at the end of the year sorting through hundreds of videos, obsessing about finding the nicest shots, trimming them all down to the right length, and then manually joining them all together.

At the same time, I didn't want to hand videos of my personal life over to some cloud service that would happily suck up all my memories so they can learn how much I like tahini.

I also fancied getting to know Android's APIs for video recording (CameraX) and video editing (Media3-Transformer) - APIs that I don't normally have an excuse to play around with.

The solution was a new app: one that automated the boring stuff, while remaining trustworthy, transparent, and configurable. Video Diary works entirely offline (it has no internet permission), is open-source, and allows users to configure the app to their liking.

I hope you like it!
